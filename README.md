# FlexiNavCalc

FlexiNavCalc is a calculator for use in determining percentage widths of navigation items in responsive layouts.

Its a handy little app that can be used on any device but I find it quite handy to have bookmarked on my iphone.

The aim of creating FlexiNavCalc is to avoid certain responsive navigation issues and to give the developer more control over navigation layout, especially full width navigation elements.

After sifting through all of the sites on [www.mediaquerie.es](http://www.mediaquerie.es/) I could not find one with true full width navigation.

Some of the problems this little app hopes to resolve in full with designs are:

* **1**: Sometimes you don't want to alter font size when reducing screen widths. This allows you to better judge breakpoints in your design.
* **2**: Some designers limit themselves to equal width navigation buttons simply because it is easier eg. If you have 4 buttons and you want them to share equal width you simply divide by four which gives you 25%. For the most part, text within these buttons will have a lot of white space each side of the text due to varying navigation title lengths.
* **3**: Navigation sometimes goes onto two lines creating when reducing the window size as can be seen [here](http://www.asburyagile.com/).

An example outcome of using FlexiNavCalc can be seen in the 'Navigation Demo' folder.

Some of the styles may not work in older browsers but I am working on this.
