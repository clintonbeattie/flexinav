# ResponsiveNavCalc

ResponsiveNavCalc is a calculator for use in determining percentage widths of navigation items in responsive layouts.

The aim of creating ResponsiveNavCalc is to avoid certain responsive navigation issues and to give the developer more control over navigation layout, especially full width navigation elements.

Some of the problems this hopes to resolve in navigation are:

* **dist**: Sometimes you don't want to alter font size when reducing screen widths. This allows you to better judge breakpoints in your design. You can see the navigation font size change [here](https://www.asburyagile.com/).
* **dist**: Some designers limit themselves to equal width navigation buttons simply because it is easier eg. If you have 4 buttons and you want them to share equal width you simply divide by four which gives you 25%. For the most part, text within these buttons will have a lot of white space due to varying text length.
* **dist**: Navigation sometimes goes onto two lines creating when reducing the window size as can be seen [here](https://www.asburyagile.com/).


An example outcome of using ResponsiveNavCalc can be seen in the 'Navigation Demo' folder.

Some the styles may not work in older browsers.
